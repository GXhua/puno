PHP PUNO updated for PHP 5.5

This is a copy of [Puno v0.9](https://sourceforge.net/projects/puno/) which appears to have not been updated for quite some time. 

What is it?
===========
PUNO is a PHP module (PHP5 and Linux/Unix only) written in C++ that brings the OpenOffice.org UNO Programming API to the PHP userspace. You can use it to write scripts that create, modify, read and save OpenOffice.org documents.
